# CALCULATIONS

# get mean value of final velocity for g1
# get mean value of final velocity for g2
# get uncertainty of final velocity for g1
# get uncertainty of final velocity for g2

# calculate KE for g1 before explosion
# calculate KE for g2 after explosion

# if flag_length != 0, then need to calc velocities from times
    # calculate g1 velocities after the elastic collision
    # calculate g2 velocities after the elastic collision

# calculate predicted velocity after the collision
# compare prediction with measured

# for each inelastic collision, calc KE for g1 before collis
# for each inelastic collision, calc KE for g1 after collis
# for each inelastic collision, calc KE for g2 before collis
# for each inelastic collision, calc KE for g2 after collis

# calc mean of KE's
# calc spread of KE's
